# Landslide Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict landslides based on various environmental and geological parameters such as soil type, altitude, slope, rainfall, etc. The project leverages machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classification to provide accurate predictions. 

By training on historical data, the model can identify areas at risk of landslides and help in early disaster management and preventive actions.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes different machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classification
- **Data-Driven Predictions**: Utilizes various parameters (e.g., soil type, altitude, slope) to predict landslide occurrences.
- **Scalability**: The model can be adapted to different regions by training it on region-specific data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- `seaborn` (for better data visualization)
- `jupyter notebook` (optional but recommended for running and experimenting with the code)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features, including:

- **Soil Type**: The type of soil in the area (e.g., clay, sand, loam).
- **Altitude**: The height above sea level.
- **Slope**: The gradient of the land.
- **Rainfall**: The amount of precipitation.
- **Land Use**: The purpose for which the land is being used (e.g., agriculture, forest).

Ensure that the dataset is pre-processed (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.) before feeding it into the model.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing the Data**: 
   Run the data preprocessing steps using the notebook to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.

2. **Training the Models**: 
   You can train the models by running the respective scripts:
   
   python models/linear_regression
   python models/logistic_regression
   python models/random_forest


## Results

- After training and testing the models, a summary of results (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be provided for each algorithm.
- The Random Forest classifier generally outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks for better performance.
- Incorporate real-time data to predict landslides dynamically.
- Use geographical data and spatial analysis for more accurate risk mapping.
